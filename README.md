# Footprint

Nutritional labels tell you about the % of the daily recommended nutrients and vitamins the food you consume provides you with. Now, what if there was also a way to track the environmental impact of the food you consume? The Footprint app allows its users to scan grocery store items and get their estimated carbon and water footprints so that they can make informed decisions regarding the food they buy. The app also allows its users to track their carbon and water footprints over time, to see the impact of their changes in lifestyle and diet. The Footprint app was built as part of the Stanford 2022 TreeHacks Hackathon with Meelad Atta, Pin-Hua Huang, and Julia Xu.
